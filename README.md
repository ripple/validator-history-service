## Installation

### Install VHS globally

To install the Validator History Service globally on your computer, run

```bash
npm i -g validator-history-service
```

### Database

The Validator History Service only supports Postgres. You'll need to create a database, but the Validator History Service will create the tables and schema for you.

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file with the same environment variable as [.env.example](.env.example) where you want to run the Validator History Service.

Alternatively, update your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to export the environment variables.

Here are some example values for some environment variables:

- `MAINNET_P2P_SERVER`: your mainnet peer-to-peer rippled node [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)
- `MAINNET_UNL`: a mainnet validator domain which hosts a UNL, for example `MAINNET_UNL=vl.ripple.com`

## Run

The Validator History Service runs on HTTP on port 3000.

After installation, you have access to the `validatorhistoryservice` command globally.

Run `validatorhistoryservice` with `--api` to launch the API server:

```bash
validatorhistoryservice --api
```

Run `validatorhistoryservice` with `--connections` to launch the connection manager:

```bash
validatorhistoryservice --connections
```

Run `validatorhistoryservice` with `--crawler` to launch the network crawler:

```bash
validatorhistoryservice --crawler
```

### API inspection

Once the service and API are running, you may inspect the API by issuing any HTTP request to port 3000:

```bash
curl localhost:3000
```
